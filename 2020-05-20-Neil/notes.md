## Lessons learned ü§î

- "`git` is a powerful tool when you know what you're doing"
- `git` is a distributed version control system
  - distributed: different people can work on the same project at the same time (that's where `push` and `pull` come into play, see below)
  - version control: you can track the different version of a project (and go back to an earlier version at any time)
- `fork` is copying a repository into your own GitHub account (it doesn't get stored onto your local machine)
- `cloning` is copying a repository onto your local machine (this is typically the first step of project setup. The next step would usually be to install dependencies.)
- `commit` is similar to a save ("A commit is very similar to a save point in a game" (Vicki))
- a **Pull request** is when you ask the project/repository owner to add your changes to the main/original repository
- `merging` is including the changes into the repository (to **merge a PR** is a thing you will hear often)
- `pull` is checking for changes in the original repository and adding them to your own
- `push` adding my changes to the main repository
- `master` is the default name for the first repository branch
